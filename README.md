# Convex-Hull-Calculator
done in Digisim'25, Udyam, EES
• Implemented Convex Hull using Jarvis March (Gift Wrapping) algorithm in digital circuits, utilizing FSMs for
point selection and ROM for storing 2D input coordinates.

• Designed custom comparators, shift registers, and looping logic to enable circular traversal of points, handling
collinear and non-collinear cases via cross-product and distance formulae.

• Integrated an 8-bit adder and Binary to BCD converter for summing and visualizing Convex Hull points as
final output.
